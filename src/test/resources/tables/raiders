[2d10] CP per week from each family

[1d8+4] CP per week from each family

that we give them the eldest son from each family to bolster their might

that we perform free maintenance and repair of their equipment

that we give them the fairest of our daughters to bear the children of their leader

free food and drink at the tavern every time they come through town

slave labor from the men in our village, who work all day building a new encampment

a cut of all the goods that we produce here

to be tipped off when merchants and travelers come through town

that we store dangerous substances in our homes for them

Worse, they routinely torment us by...

1d20

forcing us to grovel like dogs when they come through town

making many of us impart cruel abuses on our loved ones

forcing us to watch as they debase our wives and daughters

making our children fight for their amusement

making us burn our clothing and shave our heads

ordering us to make our children sleep in barns with the livestock

making us eat manure and other foul substances

ordering us to lick their boots clean

forcing us to dance for their amusement

brutally violating the men and boys of our village

forcing our children to kick helpless animals to death

relieving themselves in our well

forcing us to violate our livestock

making us watch as they destroy our market stands

making us smile and sing as they whip us

beating our loved ones while we helplessly watch

urinating on our feet

desecrating our church and assaulting the priest

defiling the graves of our loved ones

painting our bodies with crude obscenities and making us march through town

If we disobey or resist, they have threatened to...

1d20

hold our children hostage until we give them what they want

destroy our harvest and starve us

kill one of us every day until we give in

make our children suffer for our disobedience

release a dangerous beast into the home of any family that challenges them

make a bloody and public example of any family that disobeys them

slaughter our livestock

poison our well

skin the wife of any man who challenges them alive, and make him listen to her screams

construct a gallows and hang any troublemakers in the center of town

drag any who challenge them behind their horses

take our children as slaves, and kill everyone else

burn our homes to the ground, one by one, until we give in

cut off the right hand of any who defy them

mutilate the faces of our wives

force the children of any who challenge them to drink acid

draw and quarter those who defy them

gouge out the eyes and cut out the tongue of any who stand against them

bind any who defy them to a post, to be eaten by dogs

nail those who defy them to a tree, to suffer and die of exposure

What Else?

1d20

We have never challenged these fiends. We are powerless to stop them.

A small group of adventurers came through and heard our plight. They sought to help, but the raiders cut them down. We were severely punished.

One family couldn't pay their dues to the raiders. Not two days passed before those bastards made good on their threats.

Some of the men in our village sought to drive out our tormentors. They failed, and the raiders made good on their threats.

We routinely miss payments, and the raiders have yet to carry out their ultimate threat. However, they have punished us in less severe ways.

We managed to drive the raiders off, but fear that they will soon return in greater numbers to make us pay for our defiance.

We haven't dared to challenge them yet, but suspect that they wouldn't actually follow through on their threats. They seem to be more bark than bite.

We've always complied with their demands, but they recently began warring with another raider encampment nearby. Now, they ask us for more and more! If it doesn't stop, we'll have nothing left to give.

Recently, they have stopped coming to collect their payments. We do not know why, and fear to press our luck by investigating.

A second group of raiders has recently arrived, and they, too, demand tribute! We can't possibly pay both.

A stranger passed through town recently, and ended up killing several raiders in a tavern fight. He has already left, and we now fear retaliation.

The raiders have a new leader, now, and this one is even more demanding and cruel than the last. We can't take this anymore!

In spite of their abuses, these raiders are a mere annoyance. They spend more time backstabbing each other than enforcing their threats upon us.

These raiders are ruthless. Even though we've never defied them, they parade the mutilated remains of travellers through town just to remind us what they're capable of.

There are many among their group who are actually decent folk. They try to keep the abuses from their comrades to a minimum, but can only do so much. If we could bring those few to our defense, it could make all the difference.

So long as we pay on time, the abuses are kept to a minimum. We should really just be thankful that they aren't asking for more.

There is no end to this hell in sight, and our spirits are broken. We keep nothing for ourselves, and are little better than slaves under the brutal rule of these raiders.

We've had enough, and are preparing an ambush.

It's hard to make our payments, but that's just how things work out here. We'd rather not risk inciting the raiders to anger.

Just when we thought things couldn't get worse, one of our daughters was found murdered and brutalized. Enough is enough!
